    <h1>Java Application for Elastic Beanstalk Deployment</h1>
    <p>This project is a simple Java application designed for deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The application provides a basic service running on a Java servlet container, such as Tomcat or Jetty.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Account:</strong> An active AWS account to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Java Development Kit (JDK):</strong> Java 8 or higher for building and running the application.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CLI:</strong> Command-line tool for interacting with AWS services.</li>
        <li><strong>Elastic Beanstalk CLI:</strong> AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface for easier deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deployment Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone or download the project to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Ensure that your <strong>pom.xml</strong> or build file is correctly configured for packaging the application (e.g., using Maven).</li>
        <li>Build the application using Maven: <code>mvn clean package</code>.</li>
        <li>Zip the output artifact (e.g., <code>target/myapp.war</code>).</li>
        <li>Upload the zip file to Elastic Beanstalk via the AWS Management Console or CLI.</li>
        <li>Configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment to use the Java platform.</li>
        <li>Deploy the application and access it via the provided Elastic Beanstalk URL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the application is configured to listen on port <strong>8080</strong>, as Elastic Beanstalk will route traffic to that port by default.</li>
        <li>The application will automatically scale based on traffic, as managed by Elastic Beanstalk.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have the correct IAM permissions to interact with Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 resources.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Monitoring and Logs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Elastic Beanstalk's built-in monitoring features for real-time status updates on your environment.</li>
        <li>Access application logs through the Elastic Beanstalk console or AWS CLI to troubleshoot and debug issues.</li>
    </ul>
